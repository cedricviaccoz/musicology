[[["Nintendo Game Boy", "X (Japan)"], {"id": "34676", "GameTitle": "X", "PlatformId": "4", "Platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "ReleaseDate": "05/29/1992", "Overview": "X (\u30a8\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 Ekkusu?) is a three-dimensional first-person shooter video game released for the Game Boy only in Japan on May 29, 1992. The game was developed and published by Nintendo, with assistance from Argonaut Software. X was followed by an internationally released DSiWare exclusive sequel, X-Scape, in 2010.\n\n\nThe game was influenced by the Starglider series, and was originally slated to be published by Mindscape as Eclipse or Lunar Chase, but Nintendo took over the project after becoming interested in the concept of having three-dimensional graphics on the Game Boy. Then Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi renamed the game X, shortly before its release. The Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu listed X as one of the four most influential Game Boy games released, as it was the first 3D game released for a portable system in Japan.\n\n\nThe game takes place in a wireframe 3D view. The player controls the VIXIV to complete various missions assigned by the Training Academy Coach. Objectives can range from destroying enemy targets, escorting cargo, or defending bases. A short break is provided after the completion of each mission, and the player is awarded a number of stars based on their skill in each level. 10 small stars equal one regular star, and a certain number of stars are needed to continue the game after failing a mission. The game is completed by finishing all ten missions.", "Genres": {"genre": "Flight Simulator"}, "Players": "1", "Co-op": "No", "Publisher": "Nintendo", "Developer": "Nintendo", "Similar": {"SimilarCount": "1", "Game": {"id": "40383", "PlatformId": "6"}}, "Images": {"boxart": {"@side": "front", "@width": "306", "@height": "384", "@thumb": "boxart/thumb/original/front/34676-1.jpg", "#text": "boxart/original/front/34676-1.jpg"}, "screenshot": {"original": {"@width": "160", "@height": "144", "#text": "screenshots/34676-1.jpg"}, "thumb": "screenshots/thumb/34676-1.jpg"}}}], [["TurboGrafx 16", "Darius Force"], {"id": "27093", "GameTitle": "Darius Plus", "PlatformId": "34", "Platform": "TurboGrafx 16", "ReleaseDate": "03/16/1990", "Overview": "Amidst the clutter of arcade shooters in the late 1980s, companies needed to make their games stand out in some way. Simply flying a ship into outer space simply wasn't going to cut it anymore. Taito had an idea. Yes, there was still a spaceship. And yeah, that \"outer space\" part was still there too. But instead of the usual aliens, you fought fish.\n\nYes, fish.\n\nNot even regular, aquatic fish, but robotic fish with lasers equipped to their fins, giant metal teeth and missiles firing from their gills. And not just fish either. There are squid, snails, and other undersea variations out for your blood as well.\n\nThe requisite plot is about the people of the planet Darius, who are being terrorized by said intergalatic fish. Only the heroic pilots Proco Jr and Tiat Young can save the day. The constant star of the Darius series is the Silver Hawk. Much like Gradius, it has a primary, forward firing weapon, along with bombs that can be used to attack vertically, and the usual shield.\n\nThe arcade game Darius games also used a unique system that attached three monitors together to create one massive horizontal playing field (also used in Taito's Ninja Warriors.) Naturally, this couldn't quite be replicated on the console system, so that nifty little gimmick is lost, but emulators can still replicate the dimensions of the screen, even if you end up looking at a tiny picture.\n\nLooking to further set itself apart from the crowd, every Darius game has multiple levels, with several branching paths throughout the game. It adds tremendously to the replay value, especially since there are usual multiple endings, depending on which final zone you end up at.\n\nDarius is a two-dimensional horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up set in a fictional future. Uniquely among shoot 'em ups, the game's screen was three times wider than conventional size, and the arcade cabinet used an arrangement of three screens to accommodate it. The player controls an ornate fighter spacecraft, named the Silver Hawk, and must navigate through scrolling terrain while battling a variety of fighter craft, ground vehicles, turrets, and other obstacles throughout the game's stages (referred to as zones in the game). The ship's arsenal consists of forward-firing missiles, aerial bombs and a protective force field, all of which can be upgraded by power-ups (in the form of large, colored orbs) that are dropped by specially-colored enemies throughout the game's zones. When the player reaches the end of a zone, a boss appears, which must be defeated to proceed. Once the boss of a zone is destroyed, the player is given a choice of which zone to play next via a branching path. While there are 28 zones in total, only seven can be played in a single run.\n\nWhen various ports of it were made for different consoles, Taito (and others) were forced to shrink the playfield to fit on one screen.\n\nIt was released for the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, PC Engine, PC Engine (Super CD-ROM), Wii (Virtual Console), and ZX Spectrum.\n\nThe PC Engine saw three releases:  \n\nDarius Alpha (1990): A very rare beta release. This is one of the rarest Hu-Cards ever published. You could only get a copy of this hardcore shoot-em-up by buying Darius Plus and Super Darius and then mailing coupons to the publisher. 800 copies were made available, and names were drawn from those who mailed their info in. Some copies of the game were also given away as prizes by PC Engine Gekken and Marakatsu magazines.\n\nDarius Plus (1990): The full game itself, again a PC Engine HuCard. The bosses that were removed in Alpha do not return here. Both Alpha and Plus were actually written for the PC Engine SuperGrafx and playing them on that console results in slightly improved graphics (less flicker and slowdown).\n\nSuper Darius (1990): A conversion of Darius for the PC Engine's Super CD-ROM, very close to the original arcade version other than being single-screen.

Each town has a theme and can only raise the type of creatures appropriate to that theme. The resources (gold, wood, ore, gems, crystal, mercury, and sulfur) can be found mostly in mines and are gathered once a day. They are used to build new buildings in your towns, to improve existing buildings, to buy armies, etc. Each army is led by a hero and consists of up to seven stacks of creatures raised in towns or recruited in countryside. The armies are sent into tactical combat, which can occur either in countryside or in towns. If the attacker captures the town, the winner can recruit the creatures raised in that town afterwards.

The game was originally targeted to pre-teen and younger teenage girls, but became unexpectedly popular with older teenagers and women in their 20s. Angelique is credited with \"set[ing] up the speci\ufb01cs and conventions of women\u2019s games: a focus on romance, easy controls and utilizing other multimedia.\" In 2002, Konami released its very successful Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side, which brought many new fans to the still-new genre. In 2006, Famitsu's listings for the Top 20 selling love games included seven otome games. Early games borrowed heavily from the iconography and story conventions of \"retro shoujo manga\", \"the archetypical girly heroines, the emphasis on pure, sexless, tranquil romance and on a peaceful, stable setting\", but as the category expanded, other narrative and gameplay elements were introduced, including action/adventure, combat and plots in which \"the heroine can \u2018save the world\u2019 and \u2018get the guy\u2019 at the same time\".\n\nCommercially available English-developed otome games in modern times include Date Warp, Fatal Hearts, and Heileen. The latter two also include options for lesbian romance. McKenzie & Co(1995) from American Laser Games and Girl's Club (1992) from Philips Interactive were simulation games for girls developed and released in the US in the past.\n\nHakuouki: Shinsengumi Kitan was announced for a North American release on February 14, 2012 by Aksys.

Characters have HP, MP (SP for fighter characters), EXP, equipment, stats and class-specific, SP-draining special elemental abilities very much like traditional console RPGs. The player can explore his surroundings, talk to people and visit shops when not in battle, though to a limited degree as there is no world map and no way to leave the current area.\n\nThe game's core is its turn-based battles fought on a 2d grid. Characters are assembled into parties of four and the player allowed a maximum of six parties, which are usually well outnumbered. The two opposing sides act in alternating turns so that each party can move once and/or attack once a turn. Attacks are divided into distant and close-up combat. In the former, a party uses a special ability (e.g. casting fireballs, throwing lightning, healing allies) of one of its members at a distance. The range and possible area of effect damage vary per ability. If the attacking party has two or more characters with the same ability, they join in the action to multiply its effectiveness. Distant combat results in less money and generally less damage, but the target cannot retaliate. Distant attacks can also affect the field; fire and ice ignite or extinguish forests and melt or freeze ice, etc. Close-up, each unit in two adjacent opposing parties can act once. Very much like Final Fantasy SNES combat, they can attack an enemy, use an item or a special ability (though these can't be combined and most only affect one target instead of all) or defend.\n\nDragons are the player's ace in the hole. They have their own stats and gain experience like normal characters do. In battle, each party has a dragon attached to it and draws a large portion of its strength from that of its dragon: if a party's dragon is slain, the party will lose the ability to use special attacks and class-specific abilities for the remainder of the map. The beast acts as a very powerful autonomous unit that moves after its party does and it cannot be controlled beyond very simple commands, e.g. \"Come!\" Out of battle, dragons will eat anything and raising them by feeding them items is an important part of the game. Feeding can improve their stats as well as affect their behavior on the field, and the dragons develop into new forms as they grow.\n\nThe player can change the characters in each of the parties, their formation as well as what dragon represents them at will.", "ESRB": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "Genres": {"genre": ["Role-Playing", "Strategy"]}, "Players": "1", "Co-op": "No", "Publisher": "Squaresoft", "Developer": "Squaresoft", "Rating": "6", "Images": {"fanart": [{"original": {"@width": "1920", "@height": "1080", "#text": "fanart/original/9054-1.jpg"}, "thumb": "fanart/thumb/9054-1.jpg"}, {"original": {"@width": "1920", "@height": "1080", "#text": "fanart/original/9054-2.jpg"}, "thumb": "fanart/thumb/9054-2.jpg"}, {"original": {"@width": "1280", "@height": "720", "#text": "fanart/original/9054-3.jpg"}, "thumb": "fanart/thumb/9054-3.jpg"}, {"original": {"@width": "1280", "@height": "720", "#text": "fanart/original/9054-4.jpg"}, "thumb": "fanart/thumb/9054-4.jpg"}, {"original": {"@width": "1920", "@height": "1080", "#text": "fanart/original/9054-5.jpg"}, "thumb": "fanart/thumb/9054-5.jpg"}], "boxart": {"@side": "front", "@width": "573", "@height": "421", "@thumb": "boxart/thumb/original/front/9054-1.jpg", "#text": "boxart/original/front/9054-1.jpg"}, "screenshot": [{"original": {"@width": "256", "@height": "224", "#text": "screenshots/9054-1.jpg"}, "thumb": "screenshots/thumb/9054-1.jpg"}, {"original": {"@width": "256", "@height": "224", "#text": "screenshots/9054-2.jpg"}, "thumb": "screenshots/thumb/9054-2.jpg"}], "clearlogo": {"@width": "400", "@height": "75", "#text": "clearlogo/9054.png"}}}], [["Super Nintendo (SNES)", "WWF Raw Is War"], {"id": "6363", "GameTitle": "WWF Raw", "PlatformId": "6", "Platform": "Super Nintendo (SNES)", "ReleaseDate": "11/25/1994", "Overview": "Raw\u2122 slams your senses with 24 megs of the most ruthless mat mayhem ever!

The game was ported by Data East to the Family Computer in 1986, and was Data East's very first home release for this platform.\n\nThe game consists of 45 levels (30 in the Family Computer version), and no background story or plot is given. The player controls a ship called the FX-1, and collects power-up parts (called a \"wing\") to progress through the levels and ultimately defeat the Gobunasu armored mobile fortress in the final level. The game consists of two different top-view screen levels, where the player can press the second button to descend to the ground whenever they do not have a power-up. The player is unaffected by attacks from airborne units while they are playing on the ground level, but the ship is automatically brought back into the air after a certain period of time. The player can still be hit by attacks from ground units while they are on the ground level, and can also lose their ship by crashing into obstacles. The 8-way joystick controls the player's movements, and one button is used for shooting, and the other is used for descending to the ground (or un-equipping wings). The background image continues infinitely when the player scrolls in the horizontal directions.\n\nCompleting the final level of the game causes the score counter to increase to 9,999,999 points, which the player can enter as their high score. The player can also score cheap points by equipping and un-equipping their power-up. Pressing the button twice while the un-equipping animation is occurring cause the player to gain 2,000 points. The player gains an extra life every 40,000 points, so it is possible to gain lives almost infinitely.

This is done by producing various goods (Food, Energy, Smithore, Crystite). Each of these goods have their uses: if you don't have enough food, you will have less time during your turn. If you don't have enough energy, your output will be lower. If enough smithore isn't produced, there will be a shortage of M.U.L.E.s. Crystite is the big earner that can make or break your game.\n\nYou start the game by selecting your race. Some are easier to play, some harder. There are three levels of difficulty, in the easiest the game only lasts 6 turns, but the real game is 12 turns. Crystite is not available at the easiest level.\n\nEach turn starts with land claim. Each player gets to choose a spot of land for themselves from the map. If two players choose the same spot, the player with less money wins. The map consists of different landscape. River is best for producing food, plains for energy, mountains for smithore. Crystite is hidden and must be first found by taking a land sample to the town.\n\nAfter the land claim each player takes turns in cultivating their land and do other tasks. They can buy M.U.L.E.s to start production on their land, sabotage other players by buying M.U.L.E.s and letting them loose, try to catch the Wumpus for cash and try to find crystite veins. The time to do these things depends on if the player has enough food. Finally the player goes to the casino and wins a small amount of money, depending on how much time was left.\n\nAfter the cultivation phase is the production phase where each land produces an amount of goods depending on a number of factors such as if the player has enough energy in storage, what type of land is used, and some random events such as sunspots that increase energy output. Also, if the same player has plots producing the same goods next to each other, they gain a bonus. Three plots of same production type anywhere on the map by the same player also gives a bonus.\n\nThird phase is the auction. Here the players buy and sell their goods on open market. Players negotiate the price by moving up and down on the screen. The shop also has prices that depend on how abundant or scarce the goods is. So if there is a shortage of food, the price goes up and vice versa. This allows for various tactics, especially if one player manages to monopolize food, energy or smithore production. If there is no food, others don't have time to change their production types, if there is a shortage of energy, their land won't produce and if there are no M.U.L.E.s they can't change production type on their plot. Hoarding goods also has a drawback in the form of surplus where each turn a percentage of goods is wasted.\n\nThere are a number of random events in the game. Some affect one player, usually the one winning gets small penalties and the losing player(s) get small rewards. The big events that happen randomly are:\n- M.U.L.E. goes crazy - the M.U.L.E. on one of the plots runs away losing production for that round plus the money to replace it.\n- Planetquake - production of smithore and crystite is much lower.\n- Fire in store - all stock in the shops are destroyed (which means prices will skyrocket, but if you needed to buy something, you are at the mercy of other players).\n- Pirate attack - pirates steal all crystite from stores and players (in the easiest level they steal smithore). Nasty if you happened to have a lot of them waiting for better prices.\n- Acid rain storm - affects the plot under the storm and below it by boosting food production and decreasing energy production.\n- Sunspot activity - increases energy production.\n- Pest attack - eats all food on one plot.\n- Meteor strike - destroys the M.U.L.E on the plot it strikes but creates a very rich crystite plot.\n\nThe game always has four players, with 1-4 human players possible and the rest played by the AI. Because the players only need two buttons at most (up/down in auction) in auction, it's easy to play with four people around the computer.", "Genres": {"genre": "Strategy"}, "Players": "4+", "Co-op": "No", "Publisher": "EA, Electronic Arts", "Developer": "Ozark Softscape", "Similar": {"SimilarCount": "1", "Game": {"id": "368", "PlatformId": "7"}}, "Images": {"boxart": {"@side": "front", "@width": "482", "@height": "500", "@thumb": "boxart/thumb/original/front/38344-1.jpg", "#text": "boxart/original/front/38344-1.jpg"}}}], [["Super Nintendo (SNES)", "Farland Story (Japan)"], {"id": "34754", "GameTitle": "Farland Story", "PlatformId": "6", "Platform": "Super Nintendo (SNES)", "ReleaseDate": "02/24/1995", "Overview": "Farland Story is a Strategy game, developed by TGL and published by Banpresto, which was released in Japan in 1995.", "Genres": {"genre": ["Role-Playing", "Strategy"]}, "Players": "1", "Co-op": "No", "Publisher": "Banpresto Co., ltd", "Developer": "TGL", "Images": {"boxart": [{"@side": "back", "@width": "297", "@height": "537", "@thumb": "boxart/thumb/original/back/34754-1.jpg", "#text": "boxart/original/back/34754-1.jpg"}, {"@side": "front", "@width": "445", "@height": "800", "@thumb": "boxart/thumb/original/front/34754-1.jpg", "#text": "boxart/original/front/34754-1.jpg"}], "screenshot": [{"original": {"@width": "512", "@height": "448", "#text": "screenshots/34754-1.jpg"}, "thumb": "screenshots/thumb/34754-1.jpg"}, {"original": {"@width": "260", "@height": "226", "#text": "screenshots/34754-2.jpg"}, "thumb": "screenshots/thumb/34754-2.jpg"}, {"original": {"@width": "512", "@height": "446", "#text": "screenshots/34754-3.jpg"}, "thumb": "screenshots/thumb/34754-3.jpg"}, {"original": {"@width": "260", "@height": "226", "#text": "screenshots/34754-4.jpg"}, "thumb": "screenshots/thumb/34754-4.jpg"}]}}], [["", "Pok\u00e9mon (Red, Blue, Yellow)"], {"id": "2356", "GameTitle": "Pok\u00e9mon Red Version", "AlternateTitles": {"title": ["Pokemon Red Version", "\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u3000\u8d64", "Pok\u00e9mon Rote Version", "Pok\u00e9mon Version Rouge", "Pok\u00e9mon Versione Rossa", "Pok\u00e9mon Edici\u00f3n Roja"]}, "PlatformId": "4", "Platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "ReleaseDate": "02/27/1996", "Overview": "You\u2019ve finally been granted your Pok\u00e9mon trainer\u2019s license.

The player selects his actions via a menu. Aside from Shulk, the player can control a team of characters with various abilities. Team attacks are available to inflict extra damage.

The two-player option was retained and the music selection feature returns (Patrick Phelan's soundtrack to Lotus III spawned many modern remixes). Lotus III also added a third car - a concept Lotus M200 automobile - and allowed the player to choose which one to race with. The game recycled most of the graphics from Lotus 2, but added a number of new sceneries.\n\nThe Genesis/Mega Drive version bears the name Lotus II: RECS (referring to the game's new course creation feature) or simply Lotus II depending on country of release, while the MS-DOS port released in 1993 was called Lotus: The Ultimate Challenge. The MS-DOS version features the Lotus Esprit S4 instead of the Esprit Turbo SE. Apart from the slightly different car's graphics, the difference in gameplay is minimal, if any. The MS-DOS version was released again in 1996, this time on a CD-ROM.\n\nLotus III features a Racing Environment Construction Set (RECS) course creation system. The system allows users to create a race track by defining various basic parameters, such as amount and difficulty of turns and hills, amount of obstacles, type of scenery or difficulty of opponents. The created track can then be raced by one or both players. The course can also be written in form of a letter-and-digit code and later reused; these can be raced individually or in a series of up to nine user-created tracks.\n\nThe RECS system allows players to quickly create a unique track without having to use a course editor; however, it sacrificed the facility of precisely positioning turns or obstacles. The RECS system was later reused in another Magnetic Fields' game, International Rally Championship.\n\nThe Amiga and Genesis versions of Lotus III again contain a hidden game, accessed by the password CU AMIGA in the Amiga version and POD PLEASE on the Genesis.

Also one of the first to offer meaningful options to tune the behaviour of the cars. Although not quite on the level of later simulations, the most important variables, such as gear ratios, tyre compounds and wing settings were available to tune and, more importantly, proved to make an actual difference when driving. Important were also the functional rearview mirrors and an \"instant replay\" system with a wide range of adjustable camera settings not seen in other games of the era.\n\nThe accurately modelled tracks meant that the player could actually recognise their location on the real-life circuit. The detailed physics engine provided a more realistic driving experience than had been seen before, drivers could easily experience the differences in handling depending on how you entered a corner and how soon or late you accelerated out of it. Unlike other racing simulations of the time, the accuracy of the simulation actually made the 1/1000 of a second chronometer meaningful, as races could be won or lost by a few thousandths of a second. Vitally, the combination of graphics and physics meant players could actually \"feel\" whether they were driving fast or slow, and could predict how the car would respond. Even details such as tyre wear were modelled throughout the race, qualifying tyres are an extreme example of this: players could not drive more than a couple of laps without beginning to lose grip and eventually spinning out on nearly every corner. Together with the 16 tracks and the atmosphere-packed rendition of complete Grand Prix weekends, it made F1GP a favourite with Formula One and racing sim fans for many years, and is still referred to occasionally in current reviews as a classic benchmark.", "Genres": {"genre": ["Racing", "Sports"]}, "Players": "1", "Co-op": "No", "Publisher": "MicroProse", "Images": {"boxart": [{"@side": "back", "@width": "512", "@height": "584", "@thumb": "boxart/thumb/original/back/43812-1.jpg", "#text": "boxart/original/back/43812-1.jpg"}, {"@side": "front", "@width": "512", "@height": "583", "@thumb": "boxart/thumb/original/front/43812-1.jpg", "#text": "boxart/original/front/43812-1.jpg"}], "screenshot": [{"original": {"@width": "640", "@height": "384", "#text": "screenshots/43812-1.jpg"}, "thumb": "screenshots/thumb/43812-1.jpg"}, {"original": {"@width": "640", "@height": "400", "#text": "screenshots/43812-2.jpg"}, "thumb": "screenshots/thumb/43812-2.jpg"}, {"original": {"@width": "640", "@height": "400", "#text": "screenshots/43812-3.jpg"}, "thumb": "screenshots/thumb/43812-3.jpg"}, {"original": {"@width": "640", "@height": "400", "#text": "screenshots/43812-4.jpg"}, "thumb": "screenshots/thumb/43812-4.jpg"}, {"original": {"@width": "640", "@height": "400", "#text": "screenshots/43812-5.jpg"}, "thumb": "screenshots/thumb/43812-5.jpg"}, {"original": {"@width": "640", "@height": "400", "#text": "screenshots/43812-6.jpg"}, "thumb": "screenshots/thumb/43812-6.jpg"}]}}], [["Amiga", "P.P.

Hammer carries a jackhammer, which allows him to drill through a block he's standing next to. As in Lode Runner, drilling through more than one layer of blocks requires creating a triangle-shaped cavity more than one block wide, and blocks reappear after a short while. A block reappearing on top of P. P. Hammer kills him. P. P. Hammer can collect treasures and various power-up potions lying around the level. When he has collected all the treasures, the exit door opens, and going through the exit door completes the level.

Released in 1986 as a spin-off of Gradius, Salamander introduced a simplified power-up system, two-player cooperative gameplay and both horizontally and vertically scrolling stages. Some of these later became the norm for future Gradius games.\n\nGameplay:\nThe first player controls Vic Viper and the second player takes the reins of debuting spacecraft Lord British, which is sometimes referred to as \"Road British\" due to the ambiguity of Japanese-to-English romanization. The game features six stages which alter between horizontal and vertical scrolling.\n\nPlayers are allowed to continue from where they leave upon death instead of being returned to a predefined checkpoint as per Gradius tradition. There are no continues in Salamander's single player mode; however, in the two-player mode, players are given two continues. The number of continues can be changed through DIP switches. The player gains power-ups by picking up capsules left behind by certain enemies, as opposed to the selection bar used in other Gradius titles. However, the Japanese version of Life Force keeps the selection bar.\n\nMany of the power-ups can be combined. For example, an option fires a second (or third) salvo of missiles or ripple/plutonic lasers if these power-ups have been option. The ripple and laser, however, are mutually exclusive. The only power-up that can survive the ship's destruction are the options. Upon the ship's destruction, the options float in space for a brief time before disappearing; the new ship can grab and retain them if they get to them first.\n\nDescription from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salamander_(video_game)", "Genres": {"genre": ["Action", "Shooter"]}, "Players": "2", "Co-op": "Yes", "Youtube": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt9BQvDEXk0", "Publisher": "Konami", "Developer": "Konami", "Rating": "8", "Similar": {"SimilarCount": "1", "Game": {"id": "1480", "PlatformId": "7"}}, "Images": {"boxart": {"@side": "front", "@width": "850", "@height": "1100", "@thumb": "boxart/thumb/original/front/41952-1.jpg", "#text": "boxart/original/front/41952-1.jpg"}}}], [["Arcade", "Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash Of the Superheroes"], {"id": "7876", "GameTitle": "Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes", "PlatformId": "23", "Platform": "Arcade", "ReleaseDate": "01/01/1998", "Overview": "Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes is the fifth Marvel Comics-licensed fighting game by Capcom and the third game in the Marvel vs. Capcom series.

To provide fans of the original title with a new experience, a very different gameplay was implemented for the sequel, although several minor features retained connections to the first. Inspired by the bouncing pumpkin character in Cauldron, Brown designed the game around the character's movement. The bouncing mechanic proved problematic for the programmers who were unable to perfect its implementation. Technical limitations also prevented them from implementing certain animations, such as turning pages of a book.\n\nCauldron II was first released on the Commodore 64.

It explains how the diabolical Emperor Geldoblame rose to power, and it also fills in many details about the heroes from the first title. In addition, players will learn about the origins of the world itself and why the Lost Ocean is returning. The hero, a blue-haired young man named Sagi, was sent to assassinate the Emperor but found the job had been done for him. Blamed for the death, he's now on the run with two friends - a robot named Guillo and a young woman named Milly. In the initial stages, the player's party will progress in a linear fashion, moving from one area to the next along a set path. After playing the game for a few hours, players will acquire a ship that lets them visit areas in the order of their choosing, allowing them to either pursue optional side quests or blast through the main mission as they see fit.

These spells can attack enemies, dispel illusions, and heal both the body and items.\n\nEternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem also has a unique feature called Sanity. If an enemy sees a character, their Sanity meter drops. When Sanity gets low, hallucinations begin to plague the character. Walls bleed, voices whisper from nowhere, the camera gets disoriented.

Your main starship is the Precursor vessel and it can be used to travel between star systems; this uses up fuel. Raw materials are used as currency to make purchases in your space station headquarters; you can buy fuel, as well as improve your starship, buy smaller ships to accompany the starship as a fleet (to fight enemies), and hire crewmembers (who represent the \"health\" of your ships). \n\nRaw materials are found on surfaces of planets and moons throughout the galaxy; you have to send a landing module to the planet and then guide it around the surface as it picks up the materials you found earlier with your scanner. Each planet is unique in the type of minerals and metals it is formed of. Some planets are plagued by natural dangers such as lightning storms, earthquakes or lava which can damage or destroy your landing modules. Non-sentient lifeforms can also be found and stunned to obtain biological samples. Special installations, objects and ruins can also be found on certain planets and explored. \n\nWhile in \"deep space\", your starship can approach any star you come across, and then you can guide your ship around its system and land on its planets and their moons. Space is treated as two-dimensional and presented in a top-down view. There is also a starmap available which shows the entire galaxy and allows you to set your ship on auto-pilot to any star. \n\nThroughout space are different alien civilizations. These are represented on the starmap by a sphere of influence. Within the sphere, the aliens have a controlling presence and their ships will venture freely. Outside the sphere, encounters are rarer. Aliens can be dealt with diplomatically, through a series of dialog options, or in combat. \n\nCombat utilizes the same engine as the first Star Control game, where action is controlled from a top view and influenced by the gravity of nearby planets. Each alien vessel has unique abilities. Combat can also be played as a standalone game (\"melee mode\"), separate from the main storyline.", "ESRB": "E - Everyone", "Genres": {"genre": ["Adventure", "Shooter"]}, "Players": "2", "Co-op": "No", "Publisher": "Accolade", "Developer": "Toys for Bob", "Rating": "7.4", "Similar": {"SimilarCount": "1", "Game": {"id": "4870", "PlatformId": "25"}}, "Images": {"boxart": {"@side": "front", "@width": "538", "@height": "640", "@thumb": "boxart/thumb/original/front/9889-1.jpg", "#text": "boxart/original/front/9889-1.jpg"}, "clearlogo": {"@width": "400", "@height": "159", "#text": "clearlogo/9889.png"}}}], [["PC", "Star Reach"], {"id": "31446", "GameTitle": "Reach for the Stars", "PlatformId": "1", "Platform": "PC", "Similar": {"SimilarCount": "2", "Game": [{"id": "31448", "PlatformId": "40"}, {"id": "31447", "PlatformId": "37"}]}, "Images": {"boxart": {"@side": "front", "@width": "450", "@height": "500", "@thumb": "boxart/thumb/original/front/31446-1.jpg", "#text": "boxart/original/front/31446-1.jpg"}}}], [["PC", "Warcraft II"], {"id": "19737", "GameTitle": "Warcraft II: Beyond The Dark Portal", "PlatformId": "1", "Platform": "PC", "ReleaseDate": "01/01/1996", "Overview": "Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal is an expansion pack for Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness.

Some towns have a headquarters where the player can inspect and talk with his allies. While roaming through town or moving throughout the world, one can find both visible and hidden treasures and interact with certain objects.\nEach ally unit is represented by a character with a background and personality. Some of these characters are hidden, requiring specific events to occur before they will join the force. Each ally unit also has a class, which defines the abilities for that unit. These abilities range from what type of weapons they can use to what kind of spells they can learn. Units can become stronger by fighting enemies and performing various actions which gives them experience points (EXP), which allow them to gain levels. Once a unit reaches level 20, that character has the ability to advance to more powerful class through promotion. Some characters have two different classes they may be promoted to, one of which is only accessible using a special hidden item.\nBattles take place on a square grid, and each unit occupies a single square. Battle is turn-based. Each turn, a character can move and perform one action: either attack, cast a spell, or use an item. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping an item during the turn, do not count as actions.\nThe battle is won if all enemies are defeated, or if the enemy commander is defeated.

The game retains the character roster of Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors, omitting Donovan, Huitzil and Pyron from the lineup. Taking their place were four new characters: Jedah, Lilith, Q-Bee and B. B. Hood.
