[[["Nintendo Game Boy", "X (Japan)"], {"id": "34676", "GameTitle": "X", "PlatformId": "4", "Platform": "Nintendo Game Boy", "ReleaseDate": "05/29/1992", "Overview": "X (\u30a8\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 Ekkusu?) is a three-dimensional first-person shooter video game released for the Game Boy only in Japan on May 29, 1992. The game was developed and published by Nintendo, with assistance from Argonaut Software. X was followed by an internationally released DSiWare exclusive sequel, X-Scape, in 2010.\n\n\nThe game was influenced by the Starglider series, and was originally slated to be published by Mindscape as Eclipse or Lunar Chase, but Nintendo took over the project after becoming interested in the concept of having three-dimensional graphics on the Game Boy. Then Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi renamed the game X, shortly before its release. The Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu listed X as one of the four most influential Game Boy games released, as it was the first 3D game released for a portable system in Japan.\n\n\nThe game takes place in a wireframe 3D view. The player controls the VIXIV to complete various missions assigned by the Training Academy Coach. Objectives can range from destroying enemy targets, escorting cargo, or defending bases. A short break is provided after the completion of each mission, and the player is awarded a number of stars based on their skill in each level. 10 small stars equal one regular star, and a certain number of stars are needed to continue the game after failing a mission. The game is completed by finishing all ten missions.", "Genres": {"genre": "Flight Simulator"}, "Players": "1", "Co-op": "No", "Publisher": "Nintendo", "Developer": "Nintendo", "Similar": {"SimilarCount": "1", "Game": {"id": "40383", "PlatformId": "6"}}, "Images": {"boxart": {"@side": "front", "@width": "306", "@height": "384", "@thumb": "boxart/thumb/original/front/34676-1.jpg", "#text": "boxart/original/front/34676-1.jpg"}, "screenshot": {"original": {"@width": "160", "@height": "144", "#text": "screenshots/34676-1.jpg"}, "thumb": "screenshots/thumb/34676-1.jpg"}}}], [["TurboGrafx 16", "Darius Force"], {"id": "27093", "GameTitle": "Darius Plus", "PlatformId": "34", "Platform": "TurboGrafx 16", "ReleaseDate": "03/16/1990", "Overview": "Amidst the clutter of arcade shooters in the late 1980s, companies needed to make their games stand out in some way. Simply flying a ship into outer space simply wasn't going to cut it anymore. Taito had an idea. Yes, there was still a spaceship. And yeah, that \"outer space\" part was still there too. But instead of the usual aliens, you fought fish.\n\nYes, fish.\n\nNot even regular, aquatic fish, but robotic fish with lasers equipped to their fins, giant metal teeth and missiles firing from their gills. And not just fish either. There are squid, snails, and other undersea variations out for your blood as well.\n\nThe requisite plot is about the people of the planet Darius, who are being terrorized by said intergalatic fish. Only the heroic pilots Proco Jr and Tiat Young can save the day. The constant star of the Darius series is the Silver Hawk. Much like Gradius, it has a primary, forward firing weapon, along with bombs that can be used to attack vertically, and the usual shield.\n\nThe arcade game Darius games also used a unique system that attached three monitors together to create one massive horizontal playing field (also used in Taito's Ninja Warriors.) Naturally, this couldn't quite be replicated on the console system, so that nifty little gimmick is lost, but emulators can still replicate the dimensions of the screen, even if you end up looking at a tiny picture.\n\nLooking to further set itself apart from the crowd, every Darius game has multiple levels, with several branching paths throughout the game. It adds tremendously to the replay value, especially since there are usual multiple endings, depending on which final zone you end up at.\n\nDarius is a two-dimensional horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up set in a fictional future. Uniquely among shoot 'em ups, the game's screen was three times wider than conventional size, and the arcade cabinet used an arrangement of three screens to accommodate it. The player controls an ornate fighter spacecraft, named the Silver Hawk, and must navigate through scrolling terrain while battling a variety of fighter craft, ground vehicles, turrets, and other obstacles throughout the game's stages (referred to as zones in the game). The ship's arsenal consists of forward-firing missiles, aerial bombs and a protective force field, all of which can be upgraded by power-ups (in the form of large, colored orbs) that are dropped by specially-colored enemies throughout the game's zones. When the player reaches the end of a zone, a boss appears, which must be defeated to proceed. Once the boss of a zone is destroyed, the player is given a choice of which zone to play next via a branching path. While there are 28 zones in total, only seven can be played in a single run.\n\nWhen various ports of it were made for different consoles, Taito (and others) were forced to shrink the playfield to fit on one screen.\n\nIt was released for the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, PC Engine, PC Engine (Super CD-ROM), Wii (Virtual Console), and ZX Spectrum.\n\nThe PC Engine saw three releases:  \n\nDarius Alpha (1990): A very rare beta release. This is one of the rarest Hu-Cards ever published. You could only get a copy of this hardcore shoot-em-up by buying Darius Plus and Super Darius and then mailing coupons to the publisher. 800 copies were made available, and names were drawn from those who mailed their info in. Some copies of the game were also given away as prizes by PC Engine Gekken and Marakatsu magazines.\n\nDarius Plus (1990): The full game itself, again a PC Engine HuCard. The bosses that were removed in Alpha do not return here. Both Alpha and Plus were actually written for the PC Engine SuperGrafx and playing them on that console results in slightly improved graphics (less flicker and slowdown).\n\nSuper Darius (1990): A conversion of Darius for the PC Engine's Super CD-ROM, very close to the original arcade version other than being single-screen.

Each town has a theme and can only raise the type of creatures appropriate to that theme. The resources (gold, wood, ore, gems, crystal, mercury, and sulfur) can be found mostly in mines and are gathered once a day. They are used to build new buildings in your towns, to improve existing buildings, to buy armies, etc. Each army is led by a hero and consists of up to seven stacks of creatures raised in towns or recruited in countryside. The armies are sent into tactical combat, which can occur either in countryside or in towns. If the attacker captures the town, the winner can recruit the creatures raised in that town afterwards.

The game was originally targeted to pre-teen and younger teenage girls, but became unexpectedly popular with older teenagers and women in their 20s. Angelique is credited with \"set[ing] up the speci\ufb01cs and conventions of women\u2019s games: a focus on romance, easy controls and utilizing other multimedia.\" In 2002, Konami released its very successful Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side, which brought many new fans to the still-new genre. In 2006, Famitsu's listings for the Top 20 selling love games included seven otome games. Early games borrowed heavily from the iconography and story conventions of \"retro shoujo manga\", \"the archetypical girly heroines, the emphasis on pure, sexless, tranquil romance and on a peaceful, stable setting\", but as the category expanded, other narrative and gameplay elements were introduced, including action/adventure, combat and plots in which \"the heroine can \u2018save the world\u2019 and \u2018get the guy\u2019 at the same time\".\n\nCommercially available English-developed otome games in modern times include Date Warp, Fatal Hearts, and Heileen. The latter two also include options for lesbian romance. McKenzie & Co(1995) from American Laser Games and Girl's Club (1992) from Philips Interactive were simulation games for girls developed and released in the US in the past.\n\nHakuouki: Shinsengumi Kitan was announced for a North American release on February 14, 2012 by Aksys.

Characters have HP, MP (SP for fighter characters), EXP, equipment, stats and class-specific, SP-draining special elemental abilities very much like traditional console RPGs. The player can explore his surroundings, talk to people and visit shops when not in battle, though to a limited degree as there is no world map and no way to leave the current area.\n\nThe game's core is its turn-based battles fought on a 2d grid. Characters are assembled into parties of four and the player allowed a maximum of six parties, which are usually well outnumbered. The two opposing sides act in alternating turns so that each party can move once and/or attack once a turn. Attacks are divided into distant and close-up combat. In the former, a party uses a special ability (e.g. casting fireballs, throwing lightning, healing allies) of one of its members at a distance. The range and possible area of effect damage vary per ability. If the attacking party has two or more characters with the same ability, they join in the action to multiply its effectiveness. Distant combat results in less money and generally less damage, but the target cannot retaliate. Distant attacks can also affect the field; fire and ice ignite or extinguish forests and melt or freeze ice, etc. Close-up, each unit in two adjacent opposing parties can act once. Very much like Final Fantasy SNES combat, they can attack an enemy, use an item or a special ability (though these can't be combined and most only affect one target instead of all) or defend.\n\nDragons are the player's ace in the hole. They have their own stats and gain experience like normal characters do. In battle, each party has a dragon attached to it and draws a large portion of its strength from that of its dragon: if a party's dragon is slain, the party will lose the ability to use special attacks and class-specific abilities for the remainder of the map. The beast acts as a very powerful autonomous unit that moves after its party does and it cannot be controlled beyond very simple commands, e.g. \"Come!\" Out of battle, dragons will eat anything and raising them by feeding them items is an important part of the game. Feeding can improve their stats as well as affect their behavior on the field, and the dragons develop into new forms as they grow.\n\nThe player can change the characters in each of the parties, their formation as well as what dragon represents them at will.", "ESRB": "E10+ - Everyone 10+", "Genres": {"genre": ["Role-Playing", "Strategy"]}, "Players": "1", "Co-op": "No", "Publisher": "Squaresoft", "Developer": "Squaresoft", "Rating": "6", "Images": {"fanart": [{"original": {"@width": "1920", "@height": "1080", "#text": "fanart/original/9054-1.jpg"}, "thumb": "fanart/thumb/9054-1.jpg"}, {"original": {"@width": "1920", "@height": "1080", "#text": "fanart/original/9054-2.jpg"}, "thumb": "fanart/thumb/9054-2.jpg"}, {"original": {"@width": "1280", "@height": "720", "#text": "fanart/original/9054-3.jpg"}, "thumb": "fanart/thumb/9054-3.jpg"}, {"original": {"@width": "1280", "@height": "720", "#text": "fanart/original/9054-4.jpg"}, "thumb": "fanart/thumb/9054-4.jpg"}, {"original": {"@width": "1920", "@height": "1080", "#text": "fanart/original/9054-5.jpg"}, "thumb": "fanart/thumb/9054-5.jpg"}], "boxart": {"@side": "front", "@width": "573", "@height": "421", "@thumb": "boxart/thumb/original/front/9054-1.jpg", "#text": "boxart/original/front/9054-1.jpg"}, "screenshot": [{"original": {"@width": "256", "@height": "224", "#text": "screenshots/9054-1.jpg"}, "thumb": "screenshots/thumb/9054-1.jpg"}, {"original": {"@width": "256", "@height": "224", "#text": "screenshots/9054-2.jpg"}, "thumb": "screenshots/thumb/9054-2.jpg"}], "clearlogo": {"@width": "400", "@height": "75", "#text": "clearlogo/9054.png"}}}], [["Super Nintendo (SNES)", "WWF Raw Is War"], {"id": "6363", "GameTitle": "WWF Raw", "PlatformId": "6", "Platform": "Super Nintendo (SNES)", "ReleaseDate": "11/25/1994", "Overview": "Raw\u2122 slams your senses with 24 megs of the most ruthless mat mayhem ever!

The game was ported by Data East to the Family Computer in 1986, and was Data East's very first home release for this platform.\n\nThe game consists of 45 levels (30 in the Family Computer version), and no background story or plot is given. The player controls a ship called the FX-1, and collects power-up parts (called a \"wing\") to progress through the levels and ultimately defeat the Gobunasu armored mobile fortress in the final level. The game consists of two different top-view screen levels, where the player can press the second button to descend to the ground whenever they do not have a power-up. The player is unaffected by attacks from airborne units while they are playing on the ground level, but the ship is automatically brought back into the air after a certain period of time. The player can still be hit by attacks from ground units while they are on the ground level, and can also lose their ship by crashing into obstacles. The 8-way joystick controls the player's movements, and one button is used for shooting, and the other is used for descending to the ground (or un-equipping wings). The background image continues infinitely when the player scrolls in the horizontal directions.\n\nCompleting the final level of the game causes the score counter to increase to 9,999,999 points, which the player can enter as their high score. The player can also score cheap points by equipping and un-equipping their power-up. Pressing the button twice while the un-equipping animation is occurring cause the player to gain 2,000 points. The player gains an extra life every 40,000 points, so it is possible to gain lives almost infinitely.
