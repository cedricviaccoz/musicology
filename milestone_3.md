# First results

TODO seperations + text

- bla bla about the different files + logic of not putting everything in the same document
- Both analysis done in parallel, but in ML4 will converge
- Explain in a few lines what has been done and that the results were not very good
- Explain that prior assumption = challenged at first glance, seems not able to classify music by video game genres
- Problems and Difficulties, why? How to solve?
  - Bad midis, because of users (extreme tempo) -> solution ? See proportion, if not too much, remove, but need to have good understanding and control of features.
  - Bad features, for our purpose from JSymbolic? Supported by results? Some features seems useless (e.g. Violin stuff), solution = make better sort of features using Cedric's analysis, maybe create new features
  - Several genres by midi, solution = do a closer analysis of multi-genre games using random sampling, own knowledge and several sources
- Next steps
  - Select feature by feature, incremental process, feature verified by "hand"
  - Implement different solutions proposed previously
  - See if it improves the results
